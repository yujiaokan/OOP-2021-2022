# Object Oriented Programming Assignment 2021-2022
## Assignment

- Fork [this starter project](https://github.com/skooter500/MusicVisuals)

- [Submit Teams](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=yxdjdkjpX06M7Nq8ji_V2ou3qmFXqEdGlmiD1Myl3gNUN0I5VjI3RFhISk5JQzRaUkdOQTdCNEgyNy4u)

"An audio visual experience"

You should pick a song or piece of music that you like . I expect you to have to do self directed learning on the project and come up with ideas and code that we haven't done in the class.

You need to make a youtube video demonstrating your assignment and write a document in markdown format with the following sections:

- What your assignment does
- What the controls are
- How to make it run
- A list of the stuff you are most proud of. This will help me to grade the assignments.

| Grade | Description |
| ------|-------------|
| First | The assignment is technically complex with lots of elements responding to or synchronised to sound. Lots of interactivity and things to see and do in the assignment. You have done lots of self directed learning and included advanced coding techniques that you have taught yourself. The assignment uses input devices to control your assignment such as the Kinect, Leap motion, microphone, webcam, a game controller or a custom controller. The visual is synchronised to the music perfectly. You will have used PVectors, transforms and classes to create autonomous elements in the assignment. Your code is organised into classes that use inheritance and polymorphism. The colours you have chosen are harmonious and beautiful. The assignment is well documented with detailed instructions and a youtube video. You made or programmed all the art assets to a high standard. You worked on the assignment making steady progress and have documented this. Your creation is an enjoyable experience that really suits the music you are using. |
| 2.1 | The assignment is fairly complex with some elements responding to sound in a straightforward way such as colours changing or shapes changing size. There is a little interactivity. You have added a few features that you have had to learn some programming stuff for. You made or programmed all the art assets but maybe got some stuff online too. Your colours are good but could use some improvement to make them more beautiful. You have used classes, but maybe not inheritance & polymorphism.  |
| 2.2 | The assignment isn't complex and is mostly based on modifying the examples we developed in the class. Your documentation is minimal and little evidence of good project management. Development on the project was rushed and you left everything until the week before the submission deadline. There are are incomplete features or things you planned to get working and couldn't. No youtube video or minimal documentation. |
| Pass | Something very basic that is just a small modification of the code we developed in the class. Missing documentation. Completed in the days before the submission deadline and minimal or missing documentation. |
| Fail | Project won't compile or major issues. |

Rules!

- As much as possible this project should be 100% your own code. 
- There will be a feedback session after the assignment where you will have the opportunity to get individual feedback on your submission and have your mark explained to you.
- If you need to submit an assignment late, you can submit a PC/1 form to the exams office.
